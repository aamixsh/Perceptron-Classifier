| Classifier based on Batch-Perceptron Learning |
+-----------------------------------------------+
Author: Aayush Mishra

This repository consists of a program to build a classifier using batch-perceptron learning on linearly separable data.
It was built as Assignment-4 of CS-669 Pattern Recognition course at IIT Mandi, Fall 2017.

The programs are contained in the directory src/py

To run the program, use python2. (command - "python perceptron.py")

The input directory is ../data/Input
You can put more data in the prescribed format and run the programs for it.

The output directory is data/Output
It will contain all decision region plots, results and files related to results for future reference.

As the data can be huge to process, the programs may run for long times.
Also, the programs have been tested for a lot of times, but errors may still be present. Feedbacks will be appreciated.
